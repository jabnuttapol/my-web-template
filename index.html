                <h2>TOUCH UPS</h2>
                <p>Any touch ups on tattoos are up to the artist discretion. 4 weeks is enough time to know if your
                    tattoo
                    needs
                    to be touched up by the artist and schedule your appointment ( any time after that is considered
                    natural
                    aging.)</p>

                <h1>Nuttapol Sathittrakul</h1>
                <p>I was raised in Bangkok. Often, I found myself headed down the creative path of life. It has always
                    been
                    art and music that does it for me.</p>
                <p>Being an artist and a tattoo collector, I took a serious interest in Tattooing. In 2022 I began a
                    year
                    long apprenticeship at a Tattoo Studio near my apartment. I am an extremely passionate person as
                    well as
                    a perfectionist and that carries over in my work. I feel very blessed to be able to do exactly what
                    I
                    love in tattooing and music as well as being able to provide for my family.</p><br>

                <h1>The Ink Jabeer Gallery</h1><br>
                <p>Welcome to InkJabber. We are committed to supporting artists and providing a space for their art to
                    be
                    seen and enjoyed. We believe that supporting local artists is of particular importance, to cultivate
                    community among artists and collectors in our region. With no style confines and freedom to create
                    what
                    inspires, we hope to spark the intrigue that was the reason art became a hobby or career path to
                    begin
                    with.</p><br>
                <p>If you are interested in featuring your art in our space, please send us an email. We are always
                    looking
                    for local artists to work with. We're a micro gallery who features a limited number of pieces from
                    multiple artist at a time and rotate the pieces every few months. If you're interested in viewing a
                    piece more closely, or purchasing a piece, here's how it works:</p><br>
                <p style="text-indent: 0;">Call us at: (+66) 6 2310 2118 or email us at: jabnuttapol@gmail.com</p><br>
                <p style="text-indent: 0;">100% of our profits goes to art education, our favorite pint sized artist.
